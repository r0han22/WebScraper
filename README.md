# WebScraper

This program is an amazon scraper. I am extracting data for the iphone11(https://www.amazon.in/s?k=iphones11&crid=14A99AOU8RUET&sprefix=iphones%2Caps%2C334&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_7).

To change this place the search URL you want to scrape inside the search_results_url.txt file. 




dependencies (assuming pip and python3 are already installed):

pip install selectorlib
pip install requests




instructions to run:

1. place the search URL you want to scrape inside the search_results_url.txt file. 
2. run python3 SearchPage.py in terminal
3. the results are appended to search_results_output.json
