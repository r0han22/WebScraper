# WebScraper

This program is an amazon scraper. right now I have used a link for the iphone 11

dependencies (assuming pip and python3 are already installed):

pip install selectorlib
pip install requests


instructions to run:

1. place the search URL you want to scrape inside the search_results_url.txt file. 
2. run python3 SearchPage.py in terminal
3. the results are appended to search_results_output.json
